# Environment Setup Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 9, 2025

## What Was Done

### ‚úÖ Keys Already Generated
Your RSA private and public keys were already generated and stored in `.env.local.lti`.

### ‚úÖ Environment Variables Configured
All LTI configuration variables have been copied from `.env.local.lti` to `.env.local` (the active environment file).

**File:** `.env.local` now contains:
- `LTI_ISSUER` - Canvas URL
- `LTI_KEY_SET_URL` - Canvas JWKS URL
- `LTI_AUTH_TOKEN_URL` - Canvas OAuth token URL  
- `LTI_AUTH_LOGIN_URL` - Canvas auth URL
- `LTI_TOOL_PRIVATE_KEY` - Your RSA private key (2048-bit)
- `LTI_TOOL_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your RSA public key
- `LTI_KEY_ID` - Your key identifier
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - `https://io.vefskoli.is`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Your auth secret

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Two Values Need Updating

These placeholders in `.env.local` need to be replaced after you create the Developer Key in Canvas:

```bash
LTI_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_canvas_developer_key  # ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE THIS
LTI_DEPLOYMENT_ID=your_deployment_id_from_canvas        # ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE THIS
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Go to Canvas** and create a Developer Key using the configuration in `CANVAS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

2. **Copy two IDs** from Canvas:
   - Client ID
   - Deployment ID

3. **Update `.env.local`** with these IDs

4. **Enable the key** in Canvas Admin

5. **Install the app** in your course

6. **Test** the integration

## Updated Documentation

The `CANVAS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` file has been updated to show:
- ‚úÖ What's already done (keys, env vars)
- üéØ Only the steps YOU need to complete
- Your specific domain URLs (`https://io.vefskoli.is`)
- A clear TODO checklist at the end

---

## Files Modified

1. `.env.local` - Added complete LTI configuration
2. `CANVAS_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Updated with only remaining tasks

---

## Security Status

- ‚úÖ All `.env*` files properly ignored by git
- ‚úÖ No secrets committed to repository
- ‚úÖ Private keys secured in `.env.local`
