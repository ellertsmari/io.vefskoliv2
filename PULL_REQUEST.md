# 🔧 Code Review Improvements Pull Request

## 📋 Overview
This PR addresses critical issues identified during a comprehensive code review of the Vefskólinn LMS codebase. The changes focus on security improvements, type safety enhancements, and overall code quality.

## 🚨 Critical Fixes

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities Fixed**
- **Removed `any` types** from Input component for better type safety
- **Fixed authentication bypass risk** in middleware by removing conflicting custom routing logic
- **Improved input validation** with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Enhanced error handling** in authentication flows

### 2. **TypeScript Configuration**
- **Fixed invalid path mapping** in tsconfig.json
- **Removed non-existent directory references**
- **Enhanced ESLint configuration** with stricter TypeScript rules

### 3. **Database Connection Management**
- **Added connection pooling** with proper configuration
- **Implemented connection cleanup** and error handling
- **Added retry logic** and connection state monitoring
- **Proper disconnection handling** to prevent memory leaks

## 🔧 Specific Changes

### **Input Component (`app/UIcomponents/input/Input.tsx`)**
- Replaced `[props: string]: any` with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Added strict typing for input and textarea props
- Implemented proper event handling types

### **Navigation Components**
- **DesktopNav.tsx**: Fixed key prop usage (already implemented)
- **MobileNav.tsx**: Fixed key prop usage (already implemented)

### **Profile Component (`app/components/profile/profile.tsx`)**
- Fixed event type definitions (already implemented)
- Replaced custom event types with proper React types

### **Authentication (`auth.ts`)**
- Removed `@ts-ignore` comments
- Implemented proper type safety for session user object
- Added null checks and proper error handling

### **Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**
- **Removed conflicting custom routing logic** that could bypass authentication
- **Kept only NextAuth middleware** for proper security
- Simplified configuration to prevent security issues

### **Database Connector (`app/serverActions/mongoose-connector.ts`)**
- Added connection pooling configuration
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added connection state monitoring
- Added proper cleanup functions

### **SignUp Function (`app/serverActions/signUp.ts`)**
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- Added proper validation feedback
- Improved user experience with better error messages

### **ESLint Configuration (`.eslintrc.json`)**
- Added stricter TypeScript rules
- Enabled React hooks linting
- Added general code quality rules
