 * Issues a short-lived token so the browser can upload an image straight to
 * Vercel Blob.
 *
 * The bytes never pass through this function — that is the point. Previously
 * images travelled inline as base64 data URLs through a server action (hence
 * the inflated `bodySizeLimit` in next.config.mjs) and were then stored inside
 * the Mongo document, which meant they could never be cached by a browser or
 * CDN and were re-sent on every render of every page that listed them.
 *
 * Only signed-in users get a token, and the token itself constrains what can
 * be written: image content types only, and a hard byte ceiling. A stolen
 * token cannot be used to fill the store with arbitrary files.
