  theProgram: `The program at Vefskólinn is designed to give students a complete foundation in web development while also diving into 
  specialized areas such as UI and UX design. Starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, students gradually move into more 
  advanced technologies including React and TypeScript. Alongside coding, equal importance is given to topics like accessibility, 
  responsive design, and user-centered thinking. Classes are highly practical, with a focus on building real projects that mirror professional
  studio work. Students learn how to design interfaces, implement interactive features, and test their solutions with actual users.
  Workshops and collaborative assignments ensure that every graduate leaves with a strong portfolio and the confidence to enter the job 
  market or pursue further studies. The program also emphasizes sustainability and innovation, encouraging students to think critically 
  about how technology shapes society and how design can create positive change. By the end of their journey, students are well-prepared not
   only as skilled developers and designers but also as creative problem-solvers ready to make their mark on the digital world.`
